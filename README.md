Module contains two directives ya-min and ya-max, that work with input(type='text').

You need it, for example, when you want to have input with mask preventing non-numerical symbols and min/max validation.

To install:

`bower install --save angular-min-max-validation`

See [demo](http://yankovsky.github.io/angular-min-max-validation/).
